## Side Projects

- Developed a toolkit: [AutoMLKit](https://github.com/mhy-kevin-dev/AutoMLKit) to perform machine learning tasks in an elegant manner. 
  1. Import your training data.
  2. Choose whether to use regression or classification for training. (will do cross-validation automatically)
  3. With a single click, the system will compare the results of multiple machine learning methods.
  4. Finally, import your test data for prediction.
